# Peer-graded Assignment: Data Visualization and Dashboard Design Assignment

CPI Card Group’s global operations demand the need for consistent and accurate data for decision making. The business operates mostly in a single transactional enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; however,
in certain circumstances other data sources arise, including within the Service Bureau, customer elationship management (CRM), and Hyperion. The business has the need to make business decisions based on the entire outlook of the business. To facilitate this change, data must be stored in a centralized location allowing users to access in a controlled fashion. The Business Intelligence project will create a centralized data warehouse to store all of the business’ data in a less complex fashion. Making the data warehouse functional, Oracle’s Business Intelligence Cloud Solution will access the data warehouse as needed by users, allowing for faster, more informed decisions. In addition to allowing users to access the data through the BI tool, a set of standard reports and dashboards will be created and published
