# Coursera [DWH for BI Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dwdesign?specialization=data-warehousing) Implementation

Working through the final course of the specialization, which titled "implementation" as it's the culmination of all the previous materials

Each step of the implementation is located in it's own folders (modeling, integration, query, and dashboard) with its own associated README that include pictures, for the "no pic hoax" folks out there ;)

(the `course-3-etl-elt` folder can be ignored as it's just me doing things for fun while avoiding the course's instruction to use Pentaho)
