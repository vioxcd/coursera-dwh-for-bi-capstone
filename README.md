# Coursera [DWH for BI Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dwdesign?specialization=data-warehousing) Implementation

Working through the final course of the specialization, which titled "implementation" as it's the culmination of all the previous materials

Each step of the implementation is located in it's own folders (modeling, integration, query, and dashboard) with its own associated README that include documentations for each part

(the `course-3-etl-elt` folder can be ignored as it's just me doing things for fun while avoiding the course's instruction to use Pentaho)

## What's Inside

A peek of some catchy pictures ;)

### Modeling

Revenue and sales productivity table in star schema

![The schema is included in the assignment pdf](https://github.com/vioxcd/coursera-dwh-for-bi-capstone/assets/31486724/22ab4e35-bccd-49e8-8dff-db1cc27a6501)

### Integration

Data lineage for the job facts table (that is need to be upserted)

![dbt data lineage as seen from dbt docs command](https://github.com/vioxcd/coursera-dwh-for-bi-capstone/assets/31486724/bea565ee-2dbb-459e-a933-fbdca02999ac)

### Query

Example query calculating annual profit margin per location and its rank using two base tables

![The query is executed in Datagrip's Zen Mode with the terminal result below the editor](https://github.com/vioxcd/coursera-dwh-for-bi-capstone/assets/31486724/6134187d-e537-4d27-bef1-f8c82d83b321)
