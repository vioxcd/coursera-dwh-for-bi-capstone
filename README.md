# Coursera [DWH for BI Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dwdesign?specialization=data-warehousing) Assignment

I don't think I'll finish all the assignment, only the ones I find to be essential

- I skipped week 1 because it contains basic SQL stuff
- I modified [week 2](./integrations) to a kind of ETL/ELT with pyspark and dbt (instead of pentaho)
- I'm still working on week 3 - 5 (would probably skip week 4)
- [Week 5](./implementation) is the culmination of all the previous week
