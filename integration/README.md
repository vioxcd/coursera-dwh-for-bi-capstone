# ETL & (EL)T using [Coursera Assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dwdesign?specialization=data-warehousing)

**Why?**

*"Pentaho is okay, but.." + curiosity*

Two dataset are used in the project:

- `ssstores` is used in ETL using pyspark
- `inventory` is used in (EL)T using dbt

The workflow for ETL can be seen as a Pentaho tutorial on [SSStores Pentaho spec](assets/SSStoresPentaho.docx) or from the picture below

The ELT is supposed to be ETL based on the [course assignment](assets/Assignment.docx), but I modified it to be ELT. The spec can be seen in the [inventory doc](assets/InventoryDW.doc)

Each project folder contain READMEs for setup and other things

## Further cleaning up

- Create `Makefile` for setting up and cleaning
